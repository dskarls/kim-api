This directory (ex_model_driver_P_LJ) contains a shifted Lennard-Jones
pair potential Model driver written in Fortran 90.

   phi(r) = 4 * epsilon * ( (sigma/r)^12 - (sigma/r)^6 ) + shift

where shift is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, one parameter file is required.
This file must have the following format:
   Line 1: `SpeciesName' string with element symbol
   Line 1: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 2: Lennard-Jones `epsilon' value in eV
   Line 3: Lennard-Jones `sigma' value in Angstroms
